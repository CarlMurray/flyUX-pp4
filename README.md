![Cover image](/readme/cover-img.png)


### üëÄ Overview

- This Django web development project is a continuation of a UX Design project I completed during my Diploma in UX Design with the UX Design Institute which goes through the full UX process from user research all the way through to prototyping and handover.
- The end result was a user-friendly flight booking flow which was informed by user research and prototyped to a medium fidelity in Figma.
- Revisiting the project a year later, I am now using it as a foundation to build upon and bring it from Figma prototype, to a fully functioning Django-based full-stack web application, combining my passions for user-centric design and web development to build a holistic solution.

# üîÅ Process

### ‚ùì Problem Statement:

> Your client is a start-up airline. They‚Äôre looking to create an online experience that is fast, easy and intuitive: one that‚Äôs based on a deep understanding of their target users.

### üîé Research

<details>

- Competitive benchmarking was carried out to better understand what current industry leaders are doing and to understand common conventions and user expectations from a flight booking flow.
- Usability testing of existing flows were carried out with users on the Aer Lingus, Ryanair and EasyJet websites to observe user behaviour, mental models, positives and pain points.
- This research data was used to inform my solution, which aimed to provide a simple, straight-forward, upsell-free and easy-to-use flight booking flow.

</details>

### üé® Design

<details>

- The design process began with sketching out low-fidelity wireframes to explore different layout options and to get a feel for the flow.
- The wireframes were then translated into a [medium-fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/1lcdpwiJdrfa5DN0flygbf/Project10?type=design&node-id=2-3&t=7HxbLkrQd03aCuJy-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A3&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design) in Figma.
- Handover documentation was created to provide a detailed overview of the design and to provide guidance for the development process.
- The design was informed by the research data and aimed to provide a simple, straight-forward, upsell-free and easy-to-use flight booking flow.
- Branding was kept minimal and the design was kept clean and simple to allow for easy navigation and to avoid overwhelming the user with too much information.
- The logo, typeface and colour scheme were chosen to reflect the brand's values of simplicity, speed and efficiency.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Development

<details>

- The development process was carried out using an Agile methodology with a focus on iterative development and continuous improvement.
- The project was managed using a GitHub Project board with user stories and tasks.
- User Stories were sized using T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL) and prioritised based on the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).

### üßÆ Data Models

<details>

The data models for the project are shown below:

![Database schema](/readme/dbdiagram.png)

- Users app:
  - `User` - custom user model which extends the Django `AbstractUser` model. Default username field is replaced with email field.

<br>

- Core app:
  - `Flight` - represents a flight. Contains origin, destination, outbound date, flight number, aircraft, departure time, arrival time and price.
  - `Booking` - represents a booking. Contains user, trip email, flight(s), fare(s), booking reference number, booking date, total price and status.
  - `Passenger` - represents Passengers associated with a Booking. Contains first name, last name and Booking id.
  - `Airport` - represents an airport. Contains name, IATA code, locality, region and country.
  - `Aircraft` - represents aircraft flow for a given flight. Contains aircraft model/type, identification and number of seats. Note: The Aircraft model was originally implemented with the intention of using it to implement seat selection functionality and options for seating and fares configurations. However, this was not implemented due to time constraints and potential for scope creep.

<br>

- Blog app:
  - `BlogPost` - represents a blog post. Contains title, image, content, date created and content rendered which is required to render content created with a Markdown field. The Markdown field was added to the admin panel to allow for content formatting/styling.

</details>
</details>

### ‚úàÔ∏è Flights

<details>

- The Flights page shows the search results for the user's search query.
- If there are no results, an info message is shown prompting the user to try an alternate date.
- If there are results, the results are shown in a card format with the outbound and return flights shown in separate cards.
- Once flights have been selected, the CTA button is enabled and the user can proceed to the next step in the booking flow. Selected flight numbers are stored in session storage and are used to populate the Order Summary page.

</details>
</details>

#### üóìÔ∏è Alternate Dates

<details>

- The alternate dates feature allows users to view flight results for alternate dates to their original search query.
- The feature works by sending an AJAX request (via htmx) to the server with the new date, and the server responds with the new flight data for that date, and new date options for the alternate date selector.
- The new flight data is then loaded into the page and the click event listeners are re-attached to the new flight cards so that they expand when clicked, to show the fares.
- It is not possible to select a date that is in the past.
- It is not possible to select a date that is before the outbound date if the trip type is return.

</details>

#### üí∏ Fares

<details>

- The fares are shown in a card format with the outbound and return fares shown in separate cards.
- The user can click on a fare card to expand it and show the fare details.
- The user can select a fare by clicking the button on the fare card.
- Selected fare information is stored in session storage and is used to populate the Order Summary page.

<details>
<summary>Fares</summary>

![Screenshot of Fares](/readme/flights-fares.jpeg)

</details>
</details>

#### üõ´ Edit Flights

<details>

- The user can edit their flight selection by clicking the "Edit" button on the fare card.
- This reloads the previous flight search results and allows the user to select new flights.

<details>

- The form is pre-populated with the number of passengers selected in the search form.
- If logged in, the form is pre-populated with the user's details.
- The "Confirm email" field is not pre-populated and must be entered by the user as a security and error prevention measure.

<details>
<summary>Passengers form</summary>

![Screenshot of Passengers form](/readme/passengers.jpeg)

</details>
</details>

### üí≥ Checkout

<details>

- The Checkout page shows the Order Summary and the Payment Details form.
- The Order Summary is populated with the flight and fare information stored in session storage.
- For the purposes of this project, the Payment Details form is a mockup and does not process any payments. The form is lightly validated on the front-end using the Payform library with some minor modification to allow for dummy card data to be entered.

<details>
<summary>Checkout page</summary>

![Screenshot of Checkout page](/readme/checkout.jpeg)

</details>

</details>
</details>

#### ‚ùå Cancel Booking

<details>

- The user can cancel a booking by clicking the "Cancel Booking" button on the Booking detail page.
- This deletes the booking from the database by sending an AJAX request to the server and redirects the user to the Bookings page.
  A confirmation dialog is shown to the user to confirm that they want to cancel the booking.

<details>
<summary>Cancel Booking</summary>

![Screenshot of Cancel Booking](/readme/cancel-booking.jpeg)

</details>
</details>

#### üë• Edit Passengers

<details>

- The user can edit a booking's passengers by clicking the "Edit Passengers" button on the Booking detail page.
- This sends an AJAX request (via htmx) to the server and loads the Passengers form with the booking's passenger data pre-populated.
- The user can then edit the passenger data and submit the form to update the booking's passenger data, or cancel the edit and return to the Booking detail page.

</details>

### üåê Blog

# ü™≤ Bugs

<details>

1. When styling the flight search result cards, there was some difficulty in adding a transition to animate the expansion of the card when clicked, to show the fares. It was found that it is not possible to transition from `display:hidden`, nor is it possible to transition from heigh:0 to height:auto. A workaround was implemented by setting `max-height:0` with `overflow:hidden` then using JavaScript to add `max-height:100rem` (or any other large value) along with `transition:all` to animate the card expansion and collapse.
2. The "alternate date selector" on the flight results page works by sending an AJAX request (via htmx) when an alternate date is clicked, and responding with HTML with the new flight data for the given date. When the new HTML is loaded from the response, the click event listeners need to be re-attached to the new flight card elements so that they expand when clicked, to show the fares. However, when initially trying to implement this re-attachment, an issue arose where the flight cards would not expand every second time an alternate date was selected. Following some troubleshooting, it was found that the click event listeners were compounding, thus negating each other (i.e. as if a user clicked the card twice in rapid succession). Using `console.log` and Chrome Dev Tools for debugging enabled me to see which events were firing so that the issue could be identified and solved by defining the click handler function outside of the event listner function. [Relevant Stack Overflow thread.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41720943/rebind-javascript-events-and-addeventlistener-fires-twice)
3. The `Flight`s table contains 90,000 rows of data and when implementing the `Booking`s CRUD functionality, there were severe issues experienced particularly in the admin panel when trying to view/edit `Booking`s which resulted in indefinite loading times as the `Flight`s data was loaded. Django has a number of built-in solutions for this issue and a solution was implemented by defining `search_fields` and `autocomplete_fields` in the `ModelAdmin` configurations for the `Flight` and `Booking` models. [Django Documentation Reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.autocomplete_fields)
4. When testing the site on mobile, a bug was identified where the date input field placeholder text would not display. Following some research and troubleshooting, it was found that this is a known issue with Flatpickr and a workaround was found as [referenced in this JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/Sova12309/7bmpy9jc/9/).
<details>
<summary>Code Snippet Implemented</summary>


```css
.flatpickr-mobile:before {
  content: attr(placeholder);
  color: #9ca3af;
  width: 100%;
}

.flatpickr-mobile:focus[value]:not([value=""]):before {
  display: none;
}

input[type="hidden"][value]:not([value=""]) + .flatpickr-mobile:before {
  display: none;
}
```

</details>

<br>

  5. When testing the alternate date selection feature, a bug was identified where the "No flights on selected date" error message would not disappear during the transition between a newly selected alternate date. Additionally, if the fares container was expanded for a flight, it would remain visible during the request when selecting a new date. The loading indicator would display during the request, but would push the error message/fares container down. The intended behaviour was for all content - including flights, fares and error messages - to be hidden during a request, and for the loading indicator to display. Some time was spent troubleshooting the `htmx` implementation, however it was found that all that needed to be done was add `classList.add('hidden')` to these elements when an alternate date was clicked, as I had done for the flight cards already in the earlier stages of development. This was a simple fix and a reminder to always ensure code is clean and well documented, as I had already forgotten how I had implemented this functionality on the flight cards by the time I was reaching the latter stages of development.
