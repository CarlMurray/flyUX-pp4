# flyUX-pp4

# Project Background

- This project represents an opportunity to showcase my skills in both UX design and web development, bridging the gap between form and function. 
- This Django web development project is a continuation of a UX Design project I completed during my Diploma with the UX Design Institute which goes through the full UX process from research all the way to prototyping and handover.
- The end result was a user-friendly flight booking flow which was informed by user research and prototyped to a medium fidelity in Figma.
- Revisiting the project a year later, I am now using it as a foundation to build upon and bring it from Figma prototype, to a fully functioning Django-based web application, combining my passions for user-centric design and web development to build a holistic solution.
