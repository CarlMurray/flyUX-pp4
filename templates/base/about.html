                This Django web development project is a continuation of a UX Design project I completed during my Diploma with the UX Design Institute which goes through the full UX process from research all the way to prototyping and handover.

                The end result was a user-friendly flight booking flow which was informed by user research and prototyped to a medium fidelity in Figma.
            </p>
            <p>
                Revisiting the project a year later, I am now using it as a foundation to build upon and bring it from Figma prototype, to a fully functioning Django-based web application, combining my passions for user-centric design and web development to build a holistic solution.
